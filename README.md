# TopTabs

This is a demonstration of an iPhone app with tabs at the top of the screen. View transforms are used so the tab bar controller’s view is upside-down.

## Status

Last tested with Xcode 6.0 and the iOS 8.0 SDK.

## Usage

I do not recommend this technique. It is a fun hack, but messing with a view controller’s views is *against the rules*. Writing your own container view controller is a supported technique and provides tremendous flexibility.
